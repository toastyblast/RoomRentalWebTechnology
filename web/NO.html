    <h1>Hey you! Yeah you!</h1>
    <p>You are not supposed to enter this URL manually!</p>
    By doing that, you tried to gain access to a page only logged in users should be able to access!
    <br><br>
    Another reason why you might've ended up here is because your session got deleted, either due to timeout or a force logout.
    <br><br>
    Or maybe you were trying to feed the server invalid data, maybe force in a cheeky POST where only GETs should happen? Either way...
    <a href="./login.html">Quickly return to the login page!</a>
